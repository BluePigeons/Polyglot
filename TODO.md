## To Do List!

### Created initially 22/06/2016

* Connect to LUNA Database and testbed with University of Edinburgh collections images

* Display user added annotations as popups associated with rectangles as in Jack's [annotation example](http://bl.ocks.org/mejackreed/2724146adfe91233c74120b9056fba06)

* Add layers of different images

* Reduce viewport to within one page website with descriptions and maybe some CSS

* Add pages for more info about the project and contact details

* View transcription annotation layer independently of image, side by side

* Add translation layer to be viewed independently - need to decide how create multiple targets of transcription and image maybe??

	*Would this be compliant with W3 Open Annotation Data Model or just confusing?

* Display Image + Transcription + Translation as adjustable boxes

* Adjust and adapt favicons and sprites of tools to improve UI

* Develop ideal databases structure theoretically

* Create EASE logins 

* Automate LUNA API connection?

* Create Transcription and Translation databases

* Connect databases to Polyglot-Illustrated-Leaflet EDinburgh (PILED) annotation web views

* Develop user profiles databases

* Develop user profile web views

* Add some lovely CSS and pretty Javascript magic to make it all look epic and impressive, maybe use [Paper.js](http://paperjs.org) to create some cool animations and things

* Develop theoretical document ranking algorithm and/or system with Sarah

* Implement document ranking system into databases

* Introduce basic [Hypothesis](https://github.com/hypothesis) annotation layer for Discussion over the whole website for experimentation

* Connect Discussion layer login with existing user logins seamlessly 

* Create Discussion layers for individual documents - will they be connected with the whole packages of Image + Transcription + Translation or individually for each layer separately?

* Create accompanying documentation for developer usage of code

* Create accompanying documentation for contributing users

* Create accompanying documentation for end users of layers

* Create some lovely tutorials

* Incorporate social networking features into platform

* Make slideshare presentation giving overview of project

* Make slideshare presentation of all the underlying tech (NodeJS things, database things, font and languages things)

* Make slideshare presentation of all the mindmap things (crowdsourcing things, digital humanities things, transcription things, translation things, annotation things)

* Check that absolutely everthing is definitely all in UTF-8
* Double check that absolutely everything is definitely all in UTF-8

* Design full Unicode character set alternative and supporting keyboard and communication options for most languages commonly used

* Design theoretical completion rate alogrithm system

* Design collection views option to list documents by collection rather than individually by document

* Design and implement search function capacity and views








* Go out and celebrate with a large bottle of Prosecco 

* Then remember to plan the whole gamifying thing you originally planned, and that the standards and technology keeps changing, and there's that whole Webmentions thing that W3C want people to be using, and then curl up in a ball and stare blankly at a wall wishing that you had all the time in the world to do it all and still have time to go wakeboarding too. Ah well.
